   \brief Add a (transposed) Epetra_CrsMatrix to a Core::LinAlg::SparseMatrix: B = B*scalarB +
   A(^T)*scalarA

   Add one matrix to another.

   As opposed to the other Add() functions, this method can handle both the case where
   matrix B is fill-completed (for performance reasons) but does not have to.
   If B is completed and new matrix elements are detected, the matrix is un-completed and
   rebuild internally (expensive).

   The matrix B may or may not be completed. If B is completed, no new elements can be
   inserted and the addition only succeeds in case the sparsity pattern of B is a superset of
   the sparsity pattern of A (otherwise: FOUR_C_THROW).

   Performance characterization: If B is filled (completed), this function is pretty fast,
   typically on the order of two to four matrix-vector products with B. The case where B is
   un-filled runs much slower (on the order of up to 100 matrix-vector products).

   Sparsity patterns of A and B need not match and A and B can be
   nonsymmetric in value and pattern.

   Row map of A has to be a processor-local subset of the row map of B.

   Note that this is a true parallel add, even in the transposed case!

   \param A          (in)     : Matrix to add to B (must have Filled()==true)
   \param transposeA (in)     : flag indicating whether transposed of A should be used
