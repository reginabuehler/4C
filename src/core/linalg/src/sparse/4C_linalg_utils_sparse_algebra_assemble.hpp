   \brief Apply dirichlet boundary condition to a linear system of equations

   Modifies a system of equations such that dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced.
   Prescribed dirichlet BC values are supplied in dbcval and dbctoggle, where
   a prescribed value is dbcval[i] and dbctoggle[i] = 1.0. No BC is enforced in
   all places where dbctoggle[i] != 1.0.<br>
   Let us denote the \f$ A_{2 \times 2} \f$ blocks of \f$A\f$ by
   \f$A_{ff}, A_{fD}, A_{Df}, A_{DD}\f$, where \f$f\f$ stands for 'free' and
   \f$D\f$ stands for 'Dirichlet BC'. Then, after a call to this method<br>

   \f$ A_{ff} = A_{ff}, \f$<br>
   \f$ A_{fD} = A_{fD}, \f$<br>
   \f$ A_{Df} = 0_{Df}, \f$<br>
   \f$ A_{DD} = I_{DD}, \f$<br>
   \f$ x_{D} = dbcval_{D}, \f$<br>
   \f$ b_{D} = dbcval_{D} \f$<br>

   and

   \f$ A_{ff} x_f + A_{fD} x_D = b_f \f$<br>
   \f$ 0 x_f + I_{DD} x_D = x_D \f$.<br>

   \note The matrix is then nonsymmetric. When using iterative methods on this
   linear system of equations that depend on the symmetry of the matrix (such as e.g. CG),
   the initial guess supplied to the solver has to be exact at the
   Dirichlet BCs. This should be easy, as the values at the Dirichlet BCs
   are known.

   \note The mask of matrix \f$A\f$ is not modified. That is the
   entries in \f$A_{Df}\f$ and \f$A_{DD}\f$ are set to zero, not
   removed. This way the matrix can be reused in the next step.
