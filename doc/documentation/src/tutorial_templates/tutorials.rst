    All corresponding files for the tutorials are located in the |FOURC| subfolder `<4C-sourcedir>/tests/tutorials/*`.

Most of the tutorials use Cubit to generate the finite element geometry,
so we will introduce one possible pre-processing method here for the general case.
The output format used here is the binary `EXODUS <https://sandialabs.github.io/seacas-docs/html/index.html>`_
format.

The following tutorials are available to show different features of |FOURC|.
