Roles in the |FOURC| community
==============================

There are different roles in the |FOURC| project.
They have different responsibilities as summarized in the following.

4C Open Source community
------------------------

Everyone is warmly invited to download, use, and contribute to |FOURC|.
If you come across any inconsistency, please let us know by opening an issue and describe your findings.
We also welcome contributions to both the code and documentation - just follow our `CONTRIBUTING.md <https://github.com/4C-multiphysics/4C/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ guidelines.

To foster collaboration, a community meeting is held every four weeks (currently on the last Wednesday of each month), providing an opportunity for broader discussions.

4C Developer
------------

Members of this group actively contribute to |FOURC| by writing and improving both code and documentation.
They also play a key role in reviewing pull requests and engaging in ongoing development discussions.
Developers have the privilege to approve and merge pull requests.

4C Maintainer
-------------

In addition to their technical contributions, maintainers take on organizational responsibilities within the project.
They regularly discuss open and unassigned issues, ensuring that development priorities are clear and progress remains steady.
Coordination with other software projects such as `QUEENS <https://www.queens-py.org/capabilities/uncertainty_quantification/>`_ is also an important part of their role, fostering collaboration and aligning efforts across different initiatives.


Maintainers meet bi-weekly to stay aligned on critical and strategic topics related to software development.
These discussions help shape the project's long-term direction and decision-making processes.
